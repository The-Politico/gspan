He was taken to an underground prison and asked about the escape plan of his mother and brother. He did not have good answers. He was very afraid, very confused. And so at one point in that underground prison, he was taken into a room that looked like a machine shop. He was stripped and hung upside down from his ankles and wrists with his close off &mdash; clothing off in a kind ofu with his back hanging down. A cart was brought in with a coal fire, and flames came up and the cart was rolled underneath his body, and he was burned as they ask him questions. He passed out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">What were the extent of his injuries from that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They are still visible. He has terrible burn marks on his lower back and buttocks of the most severe burn that you would get from being held over a fire. He has other marks on his body from other events. He had the middle finger of his right hand cut off at the first knuckle when he was 22, 23. He was working in a military uniform factory inside the camp. And he was fixing sewing machines and working with a crew of seamstresses, and he dropped a sewing machine. They got really mad because sewing machines are really valuable, May be more valuable than the human beings who fix them. They grabbed him, took them to a table, and hacked off part of his finger as punishment. Right there, almost immediately. He has scarring on his legs from when he was hung upside down in that prison as part of the torture to get him to talk about the escape of his mother and brother. And when he escaped the camp, he called &mdash; crawled through a high-voltage fence, and his legs came into contact with the low strand and it burned his legs from need to ankle on both legs. The scars there are really horrible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">You are talking about when he escaped and went to china?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">What year?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In 2005.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">How did he get inside this cap in the first place?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</span></p><h2 class="c8"><span class="c5 c4">my new annotation</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c1">---</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Author: Tyler Fisher (TF)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Slug: my-new-annotation-3</span></p><h3 class="c6"><span class="c7 c4">Published: No</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c1">---</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c10">[Annotation content goes here]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>He was born there. his crime was to be born. </span><span class="c4">His parents were there for reasons that are almost as flimsy.</span><span>&nbsp;His father was in the camp because his father&#39;s brothers after the korean war fled to south korea. After the authorities heard about that, his father and his father&#39;s many brothers and parents were all rounded up and taken to camp 14. </span><span class="c4">That is whereshin was born. He does not know why his mother was there.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;She never told him and he did not ask. They did not have the kind of relationship where they would talk. His mom and dad conceived him because they were chosen by the guards for something called a reward marriage. Shin was bred like a farm animal in the camp and raised by his mother. physically, his mother gave birth to him, but he was raised with the values and rules of the guards, and was not close to his mother at all. He had to memorize 10 rules of the cap, most of which end by saying, if you do not do this you will be shot immediately, and the first rule, the most important, if you try to escape you will be shot immediately. A corollary to that is if you hear about an escape and do not report it, you will be shot immediately. These were basically his 10 commandments, his ethical guideposts is a little guy growing up in that camp.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</span></p><h2 class="c8"><span class="c5 c4">another annotation above</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c1">---</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Author: Jon McClure (JM)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Slug: another-annotation-above-5</span></p><h3 class="c6"><span class="c7 c4">Published: No</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c1">---</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">[Annotation content goes here]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</span></p><h2 class="c8"><span class="c5 c4">inside a paragraph</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c1">---</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Author: Tyler Fisher (TF)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Slug: inside-a-paragraph-4</span></p><h3 class="c6"><span class="c7 c4">Published: No</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c1">---</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">[Annotation content goes here]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Let me read the rest of those 10 quickly so that people can understand what the rules of the camp or. They almost all have, will be shot immediately. The first one is do not try to escape. No more than two prisoners can meet together. third, do not steal. Fourth, guards must be obeyed unconditionally. Anyone who sees a fugitive or suspicious figure must report him. Prisoners must watch for each other and report any suspicious behavior. Prisoners must more than fulfill the work assigned to them each day. The on the workday, there must be no intermingling between the sexes. Workers must genuinely repent of their errors, and prisoners who violate the laws and regulations of the camp will be shot immediately. Were they shot immediately?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They were shot often. Shin was one of the only forms of entertainment in the cap, where people actually &mdash; camp, where people actually did together to watch something is an execution. The rules were taken very seriously, particularly by the kids, who saw the results of disobedience very clearly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">What was the first execution that shin saw?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was the one that begins the book when he was four years old.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">How does he remember anything from being four?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I said, what is your first memory? He said, I remember going with a crowd of people with my mom and being very excited because it was the first time he had ever been around a crowd of people. The rules of the camp is you do not spend time with a lot of people, so that is what I think triggers his memory, is that he had never been in a crowd of people, had never served &mdash; heard this sort of hubbub with people whispering and being close together in a big crowd of many thousands.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">What is the business about putting marbles in their mouth when they are shocked?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That is a very common practice. I have talked to three others who saw this happen. They do it so that people don&#39;t denounce the guards or particularly the leadership of the country. They are just, they cannot see anything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And they put a hood over them?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Sometimes they put a hood on, sometimes they don&#39;t.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">What about his parents? What did he see with the death of his parents and brother?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The real heart of this book, and the psychological trauma of the rest of his life comes out of the escape plan of his mother and brother. What happened is when he was 13, he was living in a boarding school which was all kids leave their parents at 12 and go to live with other kids.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was in the camp?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In the camp, and a couple of blocks from where his mom was staying. He had been in the boarding school for a while. On Friday night, his teacher, a guard told him to go home and stay with his mom. Shin did not particularly want to because he did not particularly like his mom, but he did it because he was told to. When he went home that night, his brother was also what the house, which was very unusual because he lived away from the home. He lived in a concrete factory about a mile and a half inside the camp.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">His brother was eight years older.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And he hardly knew his brother. He had no relationship with him. So they had supper, the only meal he had ever eaten in his life which was salt, corn, and cabbage. That was breakfast, lunch, and dinner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">How do you eat salt?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They put salt in soup, cabbage soup and corn. That is a kind of gruel and that is the primary things, other than small animals they could catch in the cap&#39;s like mice and rats. This meal was that classic meal. He had the meal, went to sleep in the house that he lived in had a central kitchen and one bedroom. The central kitchen was for three other units besides the room where his mother slept, so he went in this room, fell asleep, and was awakened with the conversation of his mother and brother around midnight. He heard them talking and he looked out and also saw that his mother was cooking rice for his brother. Rice is something that hardly exists at all in the camp, but it is grown there, so some farm workers can steal it and his mom worked in the farm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She must have stolen some overtime and was making rice. She had never made rice for him and he was really jealous. He was 13 years old and was really jealous. P thatiqued &mdash; that piqued his interest. His father was apparently in sort of trouble &mdash; his brother was apparently in some sort of trouble, he had left the concrete factory. He would be punished. So he listened even more, and then he heard his brother mentioned the word &quot;escape&quot; and his heart started to pound. He became very upset and very afraid because of these rules. If you do not report an escape you will be executed. then he heard his mother countenancing that conversation about escape.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He listened for a while and it was clear that they were talking about trying to escape, and the rice she was cooking was food for flight for him to take and eat after he got out of the camp. He got up, told his mom he had to go to the bathroom, and went out and found a guard and reported them. First he went to a classmate, said, what should idea? They reported it together. He was thinking, how could I turn this to my advantage? He asked the guard if he could have more food as a result of his snitching, and if he could be made class leader, a position that would allow him to do less work, take more beatings &mdash; less beatings, and perhaps more food you at the guard calleds his superiors, toldhin to go to bed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He went to school &mdash; to bed and the school where he lived and the next morning he was awakened, told there were guards waiting for him. They put a blindfold on him outside the school, put him in a jeep, and drove him to this underground prison outside the camp, which he did not know existed. He was taken inside and interrogated. He went thinking they would see him as a good snitch. So they started asking him questions about his involvement in the escape, and he was frightened and confused, and he did not answer in any coherent way for his first two rounds of interrogation, which included that torture I told you about. In the third interrogation, when he was too weak to get up, he told them, I did a good job, I turned in my mother.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">You can check this out with my classmates that I told, and they did check it out. Shin was allowed to recover in that underground prison, and then he was taken after seven months, taken to the same officers who had originally interrogated him, and he saw his father was in the camp. His father had also been tortured and looked horrible. His leg had been broken in the torture and his father could hardly move, hardly walk. Then they were both taken together in that jeep with blindfolds on back to the execution grounds, the place he first remembers from when he was four. a big crowd, then shin had his blindfold taken off and he, thought, they are going to kill me now, and he was terrified he was about to be shot, but they helped his father to the front of the road and then they dragged out his mom and his brother.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">What is really interesting about this is when his mom came out, she was put on a makeshift gallows right in front of him. She was not blindfolded, a hood did not cover her face, and she tried to catch her son&#39;s I. He hated her for the horrors he had just undergone in this underground prison, and for her reckless talk of escape, and he refused to catch her eye, and she was hanged in front of him, and his brother was shot in the head three times by the guards, and then shin went back into the cap population as a 14-year-old?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">What happened to his father?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">His father lost his good job as a ladies operator. &mdash; leaf operator. He began to work as a laborer limping around the camp, and they had a very strained relationship after this execution. His father tried to say I am so, sorry we were selfish to have children in this camp. I am so sorry you had to live through this and I hope somehow you can get out of here, and shin said, I do not care what you say. He really thought of him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Is he alive?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Shin escaped a decade later when he was 23.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The year that he escaped &mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Was 2005.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">How did he escape? The escape is really an important part of the book. One thing I want to say about the experience of the execution is that he was raised in such a way he did not really loved his mother. He did not have feelings of affection, trust towards his father and his brother, and I first asked him about those things. How could you hate your mother? How could you not look her in the eye when she died? And he said, these people are competitors for food, and they did nothing for me that was useful as he saw it.,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">What about god?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He never heard about God. This is a concept he heard about when he got to south korea. Learning to trust other people and learning to feel guilty for what he did with his mother is something that he has had to do since he got to south korea and the United States. He has seen other families, other mothers and sons together, and he has begun to feel terribly guilty about the kind of boy he was and what he did but then he was not guilty.,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Does he know what happened to his father?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">No, he assumes his father was either tortured and killed as a result of his escape.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I know that this is a book that people should read. I do not want you to have to go into every detail, but escaping to China was difficult for him in what way? You said it has never happened before that somebody born in the cap escaped. &mdash; cap escaped &mdash; camp escaped.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This existed since 1958, and no one is known to have escaped it until shin, in 2005. So it was hard to get out of there, and he did it because he met someone who inspired him to think of the outside world, and I think this is sort of his birth as a human being. He was in the camp, working in the sewing machine factory, when he was assigned to work with an older guy who was I think in his early 40&#39;s. His name was park. Park had lived in pyongyang and had traveled and an educated in the former soviet union. He was a dutch word lady &mdash; worldly, and a nice guy. Shin&#39;s job was to snitch on him, because he had proved himself as a snitch. He had done it with his parents and other people. But he started talking about the world, and dark said, I grew up in p on getting. And then he started talking about something shin was really interested in, which was food. park liked to eat, and he talked about the joys and wonders in China.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">You could get grilled chicken, grilled beef, grilled pork, and you could eat until you were full, and you did not even have to be rich or important. That is the way people live outside this fence, and that was a revelation that shin could not get out of his imagination. He dreamed about it. He fantasized about living well. Park told him many other things that were news to him, that the world was round, but China existed, that south korea existed the United States, existed, but the leaders in north korea were a bunch of thieves and thugs, but none of that was very interesting to shin, because he had no context for understanding that. His context was that he had been hungry his whole life, and he learned if he could get out of his cage, he could eat. He said, that was enough for him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Cap 14 &mdash; camp 14 is how far from the chinese border?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It is about 300 miles, and it is about 50 miles north of pyongyang in the mountains of north korea.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">What was the camp surrounded with? What kind of fence?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was a barb wire fence with between eight and 10 lines that were electrocuted. This is not the type of fence where a cow touches it and jumps. It is the type of fence where it will grab you and kill you. That is the kind of fence it is. Shin heard about grilled meat in China. He got very escaped and said, let&#39;s try to escape. Park was ok with that idea. he said they would try.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He met park just two months before he decided to escape. This was all very sad, and shin got very excited. They were very lucky in their estate planning, because they were assigned in the first of the year to go up to the side of the camp to gather firewood of was not near the guard tower that was not near the guard towers. And they waited until late afternoon on January 2, 2005, until dusk, and they ran toward the fence. In fact, when shin decided to go he said, let&#39;s go, to park and park said, I am not so sure. And shin actually grabbed his hand and told him toward the fence and then park started to run.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr><p class="c2"><span class="c1">^^^^^^^^^^ DO NOT WRITE BELOW THIS LINE ^^^^^^^^^^ a very close friend, who is with the U.S. Committee on human rights in north korea, she met my wife at a book group and told her about this guy. Then I talked to her and went and had lunch with him, and that resulted in the newspaper story.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>As they ran, shin slipped and fell in the snow, on an icy part of the snow because it was cold. Park shoved his torso between the first and second strand of wire and was electrocuted, and fell dead on the fence, and pulled the bottom strand down. Shin crawled, without a moment&#39;s hesitation, crawled over his body and got most of the way over the fence, and his legs flipped off on both sides, and he got terrible burns from the voltage. I talked to an expert on electrocution at the university of Washington who deals with, people who deal with power lines in the pacific northwest, and this scenario which struck me as pretty weird and pretty odd and not believable he said, it was completely believable</span></p></body></html>
